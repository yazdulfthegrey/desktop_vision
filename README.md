This is a very simple project I designed for use with unreal engine.

I built this to give vision to my automatically controlled turret simulated in UE5 

It is an ML driven desktop reader that identifies simple objects and lists them on the screen
You can get the result by making simple HTTP calls to the local server that is opened

The file that works as a server is screenshot not machine vision

It is able to:
1) ID basic objects
2) Identify basic clothes people are wearing
3) On occasion identify if they are holding a firearm or not

   This is a WIP and is not perfect, it has plenty to improve on
